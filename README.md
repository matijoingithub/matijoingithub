### Hello World!

My name is Mati, and here are a few things I'm working on:

- Happy Coding
- Software Product Sprint
- Google Maps

I **love** nerding out about creative coding, so don't hesitate to reach out!

paint.names <- c("red","light blue", "greenish", "off-white", "yellow")
color.codes <- rabi::codes_to_colors(codes, paint.names)
 #prep the output to be displayed in a table
color.codes <- t(do.call("cbind",color.codes))
knitr::kable(
  head(color.codes, n = 10L), 
  col.names = c("Head","Thorax","R. Abdomen","L. Abdomen"), 
  align = "c", caption = "ID paint sequences for ants")
